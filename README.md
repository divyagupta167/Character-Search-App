#Introduction

The React Rick and Morty Character Search App is a web application built with React that allows users to search for characters from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty." The app leverages the Rick and Morty API to fetch character data and presents it in a user-friendly interface.

The primary goal of this app is to provide fans of the show with an easy way to explore information about their favorite characters. Users can search for characters, apply filters, and view character details, as well as explore episodes and locations featured in the show.

##Features

#Character Search: Users can search for characters by their name, status, gender, and species. The search is dynamic and updates the character list in real-time as the user types.

#Pagination: Characters are displayed in a paginated manner, allowing users to browse through multiple pages of results. This helps in navigating through large sets of characters.

#Filtering: The app provides filtering options to narrow down the search results based on character status (alive, dead, or unknown), gender (male, female, genderless, or unknown), and species (human, alien, humanoid, animal, or unknown).

#Character Details: Clicking on a character card opens a detailed page that presents more information about the selected character. This includes additional attributes such as species, type, origin, location, and episodes in which the character appeared.

#Episodes and Locations: The app offers separate pages for exploring episodes and locations from the Rick and Morty show. Users can view detailed information about each episode or location by clicking on their respective cards.

#Installation
To run the app locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-rick-and-morty-app.git

Navigate to the Project Directory: Move into the project directory:

cd react-rick-and-morty-app

Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies using npm:

npm install

Run the Development Server: Launch the development server to see the app in action:

npm start

The app should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

#Usage

Upon opening the app in your web browser, you will land on the homepage, which displays a search bar and filtering options. To find characters, you can perform the following actions:

Search Characters: Enter the name of a character in the search bar to find specific characters. The character list will update automatically as you type.

Filter Characters: Use the filter options to refine your search based on character status, gender, and species. As you apply filters, the character list will update accordingly.

Character Cards: The characters matching your search criteria will be displayed in a card format. Each card provides basic information about the character, such as their name, status, species, and gender.

Character Details: Click on a character card to access a detailed page with additional information about the selected character. This includes attributes like species, type, origin, location, and episodes in which the character appeared.

Episodes and Locations: Use the navigation bar to explore episodes and locations from the Rick and Morty show. Clicking on an episode or location card will take you to a detailed page with more information about the selected item.

Dependencies
The app relies on the following dependencies:

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows the app to create reusable components and manage the app's state and UI efficiently.

react-router-dom: A React package for handling client-side routing and managing different pages. It enables the app to create separate pages for character details, episodes, and locations, all while maintaining a single-page app experience.

bootstrap: A widely-used CSS framework for styling the app and ensuring a responsive layout. It provides pre-designed CSS styles and components, making it easier to create visually appealing user interfaces.

Axios: A JavaScript library for making HTTP requests to the Rick and Morty API. It simplifies the process of fetching data from the API and handling responses.

Rick and Morty API: An external API providing character, episode, and location data from the Rick and Morty TV show. The app fetches data from this API to populate the character list and retrieve additional details about characters, episodes, and locations.












# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
